# Spatial Data Science

This repo holds a two course sequence for spatial data science. 

- **Part 1** focuses on deterministic spatial analysis and automated local workflows. 

- **Part 2** focuses on stochastic spatial analysis and simulation, and architecting cloud-based workflows for online results storage and delivery.



# GIS 5571: Intermdiate Spatial Data Science Course Description

This is the first of a two-course series focused on teaching intermediate skills in spatial data science with emphasis on the Esri ecosystem of geospatial technologies. Students will gain the baseline skills required to build end-to-end data integration pipelines and perform reproducible deterministic spatial analyses. By the end of the course, students will be able to build geospatial workflows and data systems that can address intermediate-level spatial analysis problems.

# GIS 5572: Advanced Spatial Data Science Course Description

This is the second of a two-course series focused on teaching intermediate skills in spatial data science with emphasis on the Esri ecosystem of geospatial technologies. Students will further develop the skills required to build end-to-end data integration pipelines in the cloud, build automated quality assurance and quality control procedures for data, and run and validate stochastic simulation models. By the end of the course, students will be able to build geospatial workflows and data systems, basic stochastic simulation models, store results and model validation steps in a database, and create professional-level communication maps and graphs.
