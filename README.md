# Spatial Data Science

This repo holds a two course sequence for spatial data science. 

- **Part 1** focuses on automated workflows and data integration both locally and in cloud-based workflows for online results storage and delivery.

- **Part 2** focuses on deterministic and stochastic spatial analysis and simulation with an emphasis on architecting distributed geospatial systems.


# Theoretical Components of Spatial Data Science

| Major Concept | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| Abstract Spatial Data Types | Foundational digital representations; primitives of the field of SDS |
| ASDT Measures | Valid measures within and between ASDTs |
| Mutation Processes of ASDTs | Valid transformations and mutations of ASDTs, particularly for the purposes of data fusion and harmonization, map interpolation and prediction |
| ASDT Validity and Quality Evaluation | Ensuring parsimony between ASDT, measures, and mutations |


# Applied Components of Spatial Data Science

| Major Concept | Description|
|---------------|-------------|
| Spatial data system flow mapping | Data flow mapping |
| Spatial data system architecting | Matching functional and technical specifications; centralized vs distributed, etc. |
| Spatial data system performance evaluation | Analysis of competing algorthmic systems |
| SDS testing and quality assurance | Static and real-time testing and quality assessment |
| ASDT implementation sensitivity | How do different implementations affect performance? |
| ASDT storage | How do different representations affect  performance? |
