# Spatial Data Science

This repo holds a two course sequence for spatial data science. 

- **Part 1** focuses on automated workflows and data integration both locally and in cloud-based workflows for online results storage and delivery.

- **Part 2** focuses on deterministic and stochastic spatial analysis and simulation with an emphasis on architecting distributed geospatial systems.



## Theoretical Components of Spatial Data Science

| Major Concept | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| Abstract Spatial Data Types | Foundational digital representations; primitives of the field of SDS |
| ASDT Measures | Valid measures within and between ASDTs given different views of space, time, distance, area, etc |
| Mutation Processes of ASDTs | Valid transformations and mutations of ASDTs across spatiotemporal scales - for the purposes of data fusion and harmonization, map interpolation and prediction |
| ASDT Validity and Quality Evaluation | Ensuring parsimony between ASDT, measures, and mutations |


## Engineering for Spatial Data Science

| Major Concept | Description|
|---------------|-------------|
| ASDT Implementation | Different implementation approaches; comparison of implementations of points, lines, polygons, rasters, etc. |
| Spatial model implementation | Different implementation approaches for optimization, interpolation, and prediction; comparison of models in terms of fit and prediction capability |
| Spatial data system flow mapping | Data flow mapping; upstream and downstream |
| Spatial data system architecting | Matching functional and technical specifications; centralized vs distributed, etc. |
| Spatial data system performance evaluation | Analysis of competing algorthmic systems |
