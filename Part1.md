# Applied Spatial Data Science - Part 1

## Course Description
This is the first of a two-course series focused on teaching intermediate skills in spatial data science with emphasis on the Esri ecosystem of geospatial technologies. Students will gain the baseline skills required to build end-to-end data integration pipelines and perform reproducible deterministic spatial analyses. By the end of the course, students will be able to build geospatial workflows and data systems that can address intermediate-level spatial analysis problems.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
1. Work across the Esri ecosystem with ArcPro, Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and
supporting open source software tools
2. Create and edit data types including vector, raster, tabular, geojson, spacetime
cubes, TINs, terrain, and networks
3. Perform intermediate deterministic spatial analysis on multiple data types
4. Perform route optimization and solve spatial allocation problems optimally
5. Describe the spatial computing algorithms that underlie Esri toolsets
6. Create spatial data science documentation and workflows at a professional-level
