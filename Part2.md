# Spatial Data Science - Part 2

## Course Description
This is the second of a two-course series focused on teaching intermediate skills in spatial data science with emphasis on the Esri ecosystem of geospatial technologies. Students will further develop the skills required to build end-to-end data integration pipelines in the cloud, build automated quality assurance and quality control procedures for data, and run and validate stochastic simulation models. By the end of the course, students will be able to build geospatial workflows and data systems, basic stochastic simulation models, store results and model validation steps in a database, and create professional-level communication maps and graphs.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
1. Build integrated pipelines, APIâ€™s, and data storage systems that leverage cloud and local Esri services
2. Evaluate and validate spatial models by selecting the correct accuracy assessment metrics for the model and selecting units that are meaningful to model users
3. Be able to use simulation techniques such as to perform probabilistic spatial analysis at multiple spatial scales from individuals to areal extents
4. Communicate spatial uncertainty through written and map forms
